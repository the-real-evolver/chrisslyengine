            be created for which the SceneManager is responsible for
            allocating and releasing memory, which is convenient in complex
            scenes.

            To include the returned SceneNode in the scene, use the addChild
            method of the SceneNode which is to be it's parent.
        @par
            Note that this method takes no parameters, and the node created is unnamed (it is
            actually given a generated name, which you can retrieve if you want).
            If you wish to create a node with a specific name, call the alternative method

            The colour of an object is affected by a combination of the light in the scene,
            and the amount of light that object reflects.

            By default the ambient light in the scene is 0x00000000, i.e. no ambient light. This
            means that any objects rendered with a Material which has lighting enabled
            will not be visible unless you have some dynamic lights in your scene.
